# Procedural 4KB Demo 🚀🎮

> Tiny. Wild. Infinite. And yes… only **4KB**.  

This is a **procedural corridor demo** inspired by the legendary .kkrieger — but stripped down to **mad minimalism**. It generates **unlimited textures**, spawns corridors infinitely, and even makes your camera do a little “head bob” while you move forward.  

💚 **Tiny but mighty**, this demo is proof that **less is sometimes more** (especially if your internet hates big downloads).

## How to Play 🕹️

1. Download `game.html` from this repo.  
2. Open it in your **browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge — no IE, sorry grandma 😅).  
3. Sit back and watch the magic unfold:  
   - Procedural corridors appear infinitely  
   - Textures generate on the fly  
   - Your camera automatically moves forward  
   - Light glows in a hacker-alien-tech kind of way  

⚠️ Pro tip: Don’t blink, you might miss the next corridor.

## How It Works 🧠✨

- **Procedural Textures:**  
  No images, no assets. Just math, noise, and a touch of alien magic 💫.  
  Every pixel is generated dynamically — that’s how we get unlimited textures in 4KB.  

- **Procedural Level:**  
  Corridors, walls, floors, ceilings — all **spawned programmatically**. Each run is slightly different thanks to randomness.  

- **Lighting & Effects:**  
  Glowing green lights, ambient shadows, and tiny head-bob movement to make it feel alive.  

- **Tech Stack:**  
  - [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) (WebGL magic)  
  - Pure HTML + JS (no build tools, no node_modules, nothing bloated)

## Developer Notes 😎

- This is **not a AAA game**. But it’s like AAA’s crazy little cousin that drinks 10 cups of coffee and runs marathons.  
- Size matters. 4KB > 4MB. Your Slack channels will thank you.  
- Infinite corridors = infinite existential dread. Or fun. Depends on your mood.  
- If your friends ask “what’s this?”, tell them: **“It’s art. Don’t question it.”** 🎨

## Next Steps 🚀

- Play around with procedural parameters  
- Add your own textures or AI-generated patterns  
- Use it as a **tech demo** for NormieGames-level insanity
